## 		UDACITY Data Analysis Nanodegree Project 01: Exploring Weather Trends. 

## INTRODUCTION:
##### SQL Query was used to download (CSV) file that contains yearly average temperature of the City ‘Cairo’ and the global temperature. 
##### Then the data has been analyzed using Python Programming Language using IPython Notebook (Jupyter).

## Progress outline: 
##### • Downloading 2 data files from SQL database as CSV.  
##### • Calculating the Moving Average (Rolling Average) to make it easier to observe the trends when it be shown in Charts. 
##### • Visualizing the Data
##### • I made observations the i saw related to the data "you can find more details on the Report file"
##### • I made a conclusion about the data.

###### more details are existed in the Report file.

### • [you can navigate the data with IPython Notebook (Jupyter) using mybinder in the link below by clicking here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/samedhaa/Explore-Weather-Trends-Udacity-Data-Analysis-Nanodegree-Project-01/master)
